# Daily Coding Problems

Hi! My name is Alexis Raymond and I am a Management Information Systems and Analytics student at the Telfer School of Management of the University of Ottawa.

I have always loved coding and building solutions to common problems, but for some time I felt like I had not been coding enough and I was losing touch with the art of programming.

Therefore, I challenged myself to code the solution to a coding problem everyday as of February 17th 2020! This would make sure I didn't lose my programming skills and that I continuously sharpened my problem solving abilities.

For inspiration, I subscribed to the [daily coding problem newsletter](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) which sent me one coding interview question per day and I frequently consulted [Edabit](https://edabit.com/) which has plenty of problems for all levels.

On May 31st 2020 I decided to stop the challenge. At that time I was starting a new job which was taking a lot of my time and I had other priorities. Additionnally, I felt like the challenge had achieved its goal of refreshing my coding skills. That is not to say I will not attempt the same thing in some time when once again I feel like I lost touch with programming!

Feel free to reference my code for inspiration and make sure that you challenge yourself everyday!
