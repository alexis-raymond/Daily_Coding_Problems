# Daily Coding Problems

Hi! My name is Alexis Raymond and I am a Management Information Systems and Analytics student at the Telfer School of Management of the University of Ottawa.

I have always loved coding and building solutions to common problems, but I feel like recently I haven't been coding enough and I am losing touch with the art of programming.

Therefore, I challenged myself to code the solution to a coding problem everyday as of February 17th 2020! This will make sure I don't lose my programming skills and that I continuously sharpen my problem solving skills.

For inspiration, I have subscribed to the [daily coding problem newsletter](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) which will send me one coding interview question per day. Sometimes I'll also find my own problem to solve.

Feel free to reference my code for inspiration and make sure that you challenge yourself everyday!
